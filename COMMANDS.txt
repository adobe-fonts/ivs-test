# Command lines for building IVS Test
#
# Version 2019-06-01
#
# The following AFDKO "makeotf" command line builds the OpenType/CFF
# font (be sure to unzip the "IVSTest_sequences.txt.zip" file prior to
# executing the command line):

makeotf -f cidfont.ps -omitMacNames -ff features -fi cidfontinfo -mf FontMenuNameDB -r -stubCmap4 -ch UniIVSTest-UTF32-H -ci IVSTest_sequences.txt

# On my current machine, a late-2018 Apple MacBook Pro, it takes
# approximately nine hours to build the font due to the incredibly
# large number of UVSes.
