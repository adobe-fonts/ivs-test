# Command lines for building IVS Test
#
# Version 2015-04-05
#
# The following AFDKO "makeotf" command line builds the OpenType/CFF
# font (be sure to unzip the "IVSTest_sequences.txt.zip" file prior to
# executing the command line):

makeotf -f cidfont.ps -ff features -fi cidfontinfo -mf FontMenuNameDB -r -stubCmap4 -ch UniIVSTest-UTF32-H -ci IVSTest_sequences.txt

# On my machine, a late-2014 Apple MacBook Pro, it takes almost three
# hours to build the font due to the incredible number of UVSes.

# Note that the "-stubCmap4" command-line option was just added to the
# "makeotf" tool, and will be available in the next release of AFDKO.

# To add the "stub" 'DSIG' table to the OpenType/CFF font, the
# following AFDKO command lines are used:

sfntedit -a DSIG=DSIG.bin IVSTest.otf
sfntedit -f IVSTest.otf

# EOF
